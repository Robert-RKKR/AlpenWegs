# Alpen Wegs

## Overview

AlpenWeg is a comprehensive outdoor adventure application that supports users in planning, experiencing, and documenting various mountain activities in Switzerland, including hiking, biking, trail running, and camping. The application is built around five main components:

- **Profiles** – Manages user accounts, roles, settings, and personal achievements.
- **Assets** – Handles storage and organization of files such as images, GPX tracks, and documents.
- **Compendium** – Keeps a knowledge base with articles and information about Swiss nature, culture, and points of interest.
- **Events** – Allows users to create, join, and manage outdoor events like hikes or group rides.
- **Explorer** – Provides tools to discover, plan, and track routes for various outdoor activities.

### Activity Cycle:

- **Planning** – Users can plan both single-day and multi-day adventures for various outdoor activities. In AlpenWeg, a trail represents the intended path between two geographic points (a starting point and an ending point of trip). A route is an actual instance of a trail completed by a user. Multiple trails and routes that share the same origin and endpoint form a path, allowing users to choose alternative options based on difficulty, scenery, or terrain type. This flexible structure allows each user to customize their journey according to their preferences and capabilities.

- **Preparation** – The app provides essential preparation tools, including integration with SBB timetables to recommend optimal transport options to the starting point. Real-time weather data from Swiss Meteo helps users equip themselves appropriately for current and forecasted conditions, improving safety and comfort.

- **Execution** – During the activity, users can rely on the app as a real-time navigation guide, following the planned trail while recording progress. The interface provides geolocation tracking, checkpoints, and status indicators to stay aligned with the planned route.

- **Recording** – Once an activity is completed, users can log it as a personalized entry in their adventure journal. These entries may include GPX tracks, photos, notes, and tags such as “favorite trail,” “best views,” or “most challenging section.” AlpenWeg also aggregates statistics like total distance, elevation gain, and time, while placing strong emphasis on the personal narrative of each journey.

- **Memories** – Users can set seasonal goals—such as total distance, elevation gain, or number of completed trails—and visually track their progress over time. Progress bars, milestone markers, and completion indicators keep users motivated and aware of their journey's arc. As each activity is logged, the app updates goal progress in real time, creating a clear path toward personal achievement and long-term motivation.

### Compendium

The AlpenWegs Compendium is a rich resource that provides users with valuable insights into the regions they explore. Covering topics such as local trails, regions, cities, historical landmarks, and Switzerland's unique flora and fauna, this database enhances users' understanding and appreciation of Swiss landscapes. By providing comprehensive information on the cultural and natural history of each location, the Compendium turns hiking into an inspirational experience, fostering a deeper connection between hikers and the places they visit.

### Event Planning

AlpenWegs includes a social event planning feature that allows users to organize and participate in hiking events with others. Whether planning group walks, meet-ups, or community challenges, users can connect with other enthusiasts who share similar interests. This feature promotes camaraderie and social engagement, allowing users to discover new trails together and create shared memories in the Swiss Alps.

### Summary

The aim of AlpenWegs is to support all stages of hiking, providing a clear and practical process from initial planning to post-hike reflection. This structure encourages organized, prepared, and informed hiking in the Swiss countryside.

## Purpose and Vision

The main objective of AlpenWegs is to provide a complete solution for hiking in the Swiss Alps, giving users the tools to plan their next outdoor adventure. A key feature of the application is the Hiking Cycle, which guides users through each of the essential phases of the hiking experience: Planning, Preparation, Execution, Records, and Future Goals. This structured approach supports walkers from the initial idea of a walk to post-hike reflection.

The Hiking Cycle is complemented by the Compendium, a comprehensive resource providing valuable information on local trails, Swiss regions, cities, and landmarks. This database not only enhances practical planning but also fosters a deeper connection with the Swiss landscape by sharing the unique history and natural beauty of each area.

To further enrich the hiking experience, AlpenWegs also includes an events feature that allows users to create and join social gatherings related to hiking. This feature encourages community building and shared outdoor experiences, allowing users to connect with others who share their passion for exploring the Swiss Alps.
