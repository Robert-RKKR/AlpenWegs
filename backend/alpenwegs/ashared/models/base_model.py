Abstract Base Model for Standardized Object Management
------------------------------------------------------

This model provides a foundational structure for all application models, 
ensuring each object has a unique identifier and built-in lifecycle 
management methods.

Key Features:
- Unique ID (UUIDv4) as the primary key.
- Standardized model representation.
