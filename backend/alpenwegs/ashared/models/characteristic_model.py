"""
Abstract Base Model for Route Characteristics
---------------------------------------------

This abstract base model provides a standardized way to store 
characteristics and requirements associated with routes and trips.
It includes difficulty ratings, stamina and experience 
requirements, risk descriptions, and seasonal availability.

Typical use cases include:
- Hiking, climbing, biking, or other outdoor routes.
- Classifying routes by difficulty, risk, and suitability.
- Providing guidance for users to assess their readiness 
  and plan trips safely.

Intended for inheritance by models that represent routes or 
other entities that require standardized metadata on difficulty 
and seasonal conditions.
