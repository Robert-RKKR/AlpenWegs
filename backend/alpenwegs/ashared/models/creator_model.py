Abstract Base Model for Ownership and Visibility
-------------------------------------------------

This abstract model serves as a foundation for tracking the ownership 
of objects within the system. It ensures that each object is linked 
to a creator (a registered member) and includes an `is_public` flag 
to control its visibility.

    An abstract base model for tracking object ownership and visibility.

    This model provides a `creator` field to associate each object 
    with the user who created it, enabling ownership tracking. It 
    also includes an `is_public` field to control whether the object 
    is accessible to other users.

    Intended to be inherited by models that require:
    - Ownership tracking via a foreign key to the user model.
    - A visibility flag to define public or private access.
