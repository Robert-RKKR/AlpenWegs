"""
Abstract GPX Track Model for Collecting Extended GPX Activity Data
------------------------------------------------------------------

This abstract model extends the Base GPX Model by incorporating
advanced, user-specific GPX activity metrics. It is designed for
handling detailed performance data derived from recorded GPX tracks,
such as heart rate, speed, movement analysis, and environmental
conditions.

Key Features:
- Extends the basic GPX data model with additional activity-related
    statistics (e.g., average speed, heart rate, moving time).
- Stores information about environmental context such as weather
    conditions and temperature.
- Provides enhanced support for performance and endurance tracking.
- Designed to be inherited by models that represent recorded
    user activities or performance-based route data.
