    Represents a single Section within the AlpenWegs ecosystem.

    A Section is the smallest, well-defined structural component of a full
    Route. It represents a logically cohesive trail segment such as a valley
    passage, ridge traversal, lakeside contour, alpine ascent, or technical
    via ferrata stretch. Sections combine navigational geometry (GPX line),
    sport-specific attributes (difficulty, allowed sports), descriptive
    metadata, and relationships to Points of Interest, Regions, and visual
    media.

    Sections allow Routes to be built from modular, reusable, and clearly
    delineated parts. This structure supports multi-route reuse (the same
    Section may appear in multiple Routes), flexible trail construction,
    detailed segment-level analytics, and user-friendly map presentation.
