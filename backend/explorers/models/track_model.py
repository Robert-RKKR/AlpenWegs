    Represents a single user-recorded outdoor activity based on GPS data.
    A Track captures one continuous segment of movement—such as hiking,
    biking, running, back packing, ski touring, or any similar activity.
    Tracks may form part of a multi-day Journey and may optionally reference
    an official Route that inspired, guided, or aligns with the recorded
    path. Alongside spatial and elevation data, Tracks store environmental,
    group-related, and safety-relevant metadata, offering a concise yet
    complete depiction of the user's real-world outdoor experience.
